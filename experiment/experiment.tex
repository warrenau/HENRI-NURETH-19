The main facility, seen in \Cref{fig:HENRI Facility}, is set up similarly to a shock tube, with a driver tank on the floor, an intermediate tube section, a test section, and a reflector section. The whole facility is upside-down to the HENRI cartridge orientation in the TREAT core. In the reactor, the driver tank will be above the core with the test section in the fuel. The reflector section will extend past the fuel to provide space for the gas reflection effects outside of the active region in the core. The intermediate section allows for the driver tank to be positioned above the reactor core while also decreasing the total required volume of helium-3 for the HENRI system. The facility is made using 304 stainless steel. The test section and reflector are pipe with a \SI{4.826}{\centi\meter} outer diameter and \SI{0.368}{\centi\meter} wall thickness (1.5 inch schedule 40 NPS); the intermediate section is \SI{3.175}{\centi\meter} (1.25 inch) outer diameter tubing with \SI{0.3175}{\centi\meter} ($0.125$ inch) wall thickness; and the driver tank is pipe with a \SI{16.8275}{\centi\meter} outer diameter and \SI{0.7112}{\centi\meter} wall thickness (6 inch schedule 40 NPS). The piston valve is attached to the top flange of the driver tank and hangs inside.

The facility uses 13 pressure transducers and 1 thermocouple. The pressure transducers are one of two main types: Omega PX459 or PCB 113B24. All of the Omega pressure transducers are 0-1500 psia, except for two: a 0-3500 psia transducer used on the driver tank, and a 0-15 psia transducer used for the vacuum line. The Omega pressure transducers output a current from 4-\SI{20}{\milli\amp}, which is converted to voltage using a \SI{250}{\ohm} shunt resistor. The PCB transducers output a signal that is sent through a PCB Model 482C signal conditioner before being output to the voltage card. The data acquisition system uses a National Instruments (NI) PXIe-1085 chassis with a NI PXIe-8135 controller, a NI PXIe-4303 voltage input card for reading the instrumentation, and a NI PXI-6515 digital output card for controlling the solenoid valves. A piping and instrumentation diagram (P\&ID) for operating the piston valve can be seen in \Cref{fig:sv pid}. There is a manifold of four (4) solenoid valves used to operate the piston. SV-PI2 and SV-PI4 open to fill the top and bottom chamber, respectively; and SV-PI1 and SV-PI3 open to vent the top and bottom chamber, respectively. These solenoid valves are Parker Series 9 Miniature Calibrant Valve 009-0172-900. This particular valve was selected for its small form factor, high pressure rating, and low leak rate.

\subsection{Experimental Methodology} \label{s:methodology}

% we tested the plugs and o-rings for durability / sealing with sustained seal tests and repeated seal tests outside of the henri facility (just using the flange and piston)
% we tested the valve / plugs / o-rings in henri tests

The overall methodology for testing the piston valve includes two main parts: testing the plug designs for durability and sealing after large numbers of cycles; and testing the piston valve's performance in HENRI helium insertions. Testing the plugs was performed by cycling the piston valve to simulate the wear of long term use and comparing its sealing ability before and after the cycles. The LabVIEW code used for data acquisition was modified to automate the piston cycling process, so the plugs could be cycled overnight, then tested the next day to determine the seal degradation due to wear. This method was used for both the metal-to-metal seal plug and the o-ring plug. The valve's performance was tested by performing HENRI helium insertions at varying initial pressures to characterize the system's pressurization with the valve and compare the valve to the rupture disks.
