%      (2) Different versions of LaTeX have been observed to

%          If this occurs, adjust the "topmargin" value in the

\begin{abstract}
The restart of the Transient REactor Test (TREAT) facility combined with the Resumption of Transient Testing Program (RTTP) has generated an increased interest in mimicking Reactivity Initiated  Accident (RIA) events conditions for Light Water Reactor within TREAT itself. One of the engineering challenges for this task is to increase the energy deposition rate on the tested fuel element by shortening the width of the  power  pulse  from  its  current  89  milliseconds down  to  40 milliseconds. To overcome  this  challenge, Idaho National Laboratory (INL) proposed a design, consisting of rapidly pressurizing a specially designed hollow control rod with Helium-3. The insertion of negative reactivity in the form of Helium-3, a strong neutron  absorber,  must  be  well  predicted and repeatable.  In  this  prospect,  an  out-of-pile  prototype,  the Helium  Negative  Reactivity  Insertion  (HENRI) facility, has been designed  and  built  at  Oregon  State University (OSU) to  assess  the  feasibility,  the  repeatability, and  the control of such process. Tests performed with rupture disks provided characterization of the physics of the system, however the system requires a more repeatable and precise method of gas injection. To meet this need, a valve has been designed and tested using a pneumatic piston which can open rapidly and repeatedly for precise control of the system. These tests characterized the valve performance and provided confidence in the operation of the system, both of which are critical to understand and control the Helium-3 density evolution in the core.

% probably similar to previous HENRI NURETH intro
% motivations for TREAT RIA testing / HENRI project

% discuss design requirements of fast opening valve -- why piston valve; why does burst disk not work
% discuss design iterations of piston valve -- first mount / metal-metal seal, then improved mount, and o-ring on plug
\input{design/design}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXPERIMENT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% discuss experimental set up, differences between this set up and the previous rupture disk set up
% discuss differences in piston valve iterations and why changes were made
% pictures and stuff
% maybe test matrix?
